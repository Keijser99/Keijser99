- 👋 Hi, I’m @Keijser99
- 👀 I’m interested in making and (of course) playing games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and following the study Game Development on the 'Hogeschool van Amsterdam'.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever may help me get to learn how to make games myself.
- 📫 How to reach me: By my e-mail, nino.keijser@hva.nl

Have a nice day! :smile:
